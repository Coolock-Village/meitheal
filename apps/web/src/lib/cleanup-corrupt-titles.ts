/**
 * Cleanup Corrupt Titles — One-time migration + duplicate purge
 *
 * @domain tasks
 * @bounded-context data-integrity
 *
 * Fixes corrupt task titles caused by HA todo/calendar sync loop
 * writing concatenated summary strings like
 * "📋 MTH-82: 📋 MTH-81: ... actual title — DUE — DUE"
 *
 * Phase 1: Delete duplicate tasks — tasks whose titles contain
 *   recursive MTH-NN prefixes are loop-created clones of the
 *   original task. Safe to delete because the original task
 *   (with the real title) still exists.
 * Phase 2: Sanitize remaining titles — strip any leftover prefix
 *   or suffix corruption patterns.
 *
 * Called from ha-startup.ts on first connect. Idempotent — safe to re-run.
 *
 * @kcs The corruption pattern is:
 * 1. Recursive "📋 MTH-NN: " prefixes (outbound sync formatted summary
 *    re-imported as new inbound task, then re-exported, each cycle adding
 *    another prefix layer)
 * 2. Trailing "— DUE" repetitions (due date indicator appended per cycle)
 * 3. The actual title is buried inside the concatenation

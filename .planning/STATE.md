# Meitheal — Project State

## Project Reference

**Meitheal** — the cooperative task and life engine for your home.
Local-first task orchestration with HA calendar sync and Vikunja compatibility.

## Current Position

- **Planning model:** dual-track (`Primary Delivery` + `Extension Track`)
- **Primary Delivery:** 6 of 6 phases complete (`01-06 complete`)
- **Extension Track:** 4 of 4 phases complete (`15-18 complete`)
- **Overall phase count:** 10 of 10 complete
- **Current execution focus:** All iteration-2 phases complete. Next: PR #1 triage or iteration-05 per ADR-006.

## Recent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026-02-28 | Adopt dual-track phase model | Preserve mixed numbering `01-06` + `15-18` without data loss |
| 2026-02-28 | Keep phase `06` as planned | Existing `06-*` plans remain draft/pre-execution |
| 2026-02-28 | Execute extension-track phases `15-18` | Implemented via commit series and reconciled with phase summaries |
| 2026-02-28 | Normalize phase-17 plan naming | `17-PLAN.md` -> `17-01-PLAN.md` for consistency |

## Known Blockers / Concerns

1. PR #1 check suite still reports failing required checks.
2. `perf-budgets` currently fails in CI:

- run `22519500812`, job `65242131624`
- run `22519501663`, job `65242133779`
- observed `clientBytes=81700` vs budget `65536`.

3. CodeQL check-suite still shows a failing entry while newer dynamic runs have passed; check-suite reconciliation is required before merge.

## Pending Todo Queue

1. Resolve PR #1 failing checks (`perf-budgets`, CodeQL status reconciliation).
2. Decide whether to execute phase `06` draft plans or replace with a fresh phase-06 plan set.
3. Run live HA workflow with real calendar entity and `HA_TOKEN`.
4. Run live Vikunja voice-assistant compatibility workflow on deployed environment.
5. Monitor perf-budget headroom and reduce client bundle size before further UI expansion.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-28T11:20:00Z
Stopped at: extension-track phase artifacts reconciled (`15-18` evidence-complete).
Resume hint: start with PR #1 check triage, then choose phase-06 execution or roadmap extension.

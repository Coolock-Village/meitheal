"""Meitheal backup platform — pre/post-backup hooks for HA Core.

Implements the Home Assistant backup platform so the HA Core backup
system can coordinate with Meitheal before and after creating backups.

Pre-backup: calls the addon's /api/backup/prepare endpoint to flush
the SQLite WAL to disk, ensuring data consistency in the snapshot.

Post-backup: calls the addon's /api/backup/complete endpoint to signal
that normal operations can resume.

@see https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/platform/backup/#adding-support
